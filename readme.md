# Microblog

This is a microblogging service I made following Miguel Grinberg's Flask [Tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). It is live on http://nakul-microblog.herokuapp.com/.

## Features
* Ability to create and edit posts.
* Commenting on other users' posts.
* Facebook OAuth.
* User management, including managing logins, sessions, user roles, profiles and user avatars.
* Following and being followed by users (this shows your blog posts on their home pages).

## Tools
This app is built on Flask and PostgreSQL. It is deployed via Heroku. It also uses SQLAlchemy as an ORM.
